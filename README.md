## Problem Statement

## Goal
- From the given data create a Power Bi dashboard shows how covid spread across the world.
- It shows in detail about Confirmed, Recovered and Deaths cases in that country on a map in power bi dashboard.

### Our execution plan
- Our plan is to clean data in jupyter notebook using python and pandas.
- After cleaning data convert it into a single excel file.
- Import that file in Power BI.
- Create dashboard using Power BI.

#### Data Cleaning into jupyter and converting to excel file.
- We are given data into excdl file.
- We have to perform data cleaning over it using pandas and convert data into excel file.
- During cleaning we have to create new dataframes.
  
#### Build an interactive dashboard using Power BI.
- Build a structure of dashboard.
- Add map chart apply tooltip over it such as while hover on any country it shows all details about the covid cases there.
- Apply slicers to select the range of date to check the spread across each country.
